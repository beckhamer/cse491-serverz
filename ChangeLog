* Added arbitrary SCRIPT_NAME and SERVER_NAME for server-imageapp.py
  Also added the same in server.py
* Fixed some inconsistancies in the templates
* Edited the README.txt to denote what the different server.py's do

2014-02-19  Maxwell Brown

* Added file opening function in app.py
* Added file.txt and image.jpg for their respective files
* Changed the returning of data in app.py; data builds
  earlier rather than at the end

2014-02-18  Maxwell Brown

* Moved the fieldstorage to app.py from server.py
* Added server-qx.py to check for standard WSGI compatability
* Changed app.py to return a list/generator and server.py
  to handle the return of a list/generator


2014-02-11  Maxwell Brown

* Added app.py and moved content creation from server.py to it
* Refactored for environ dictionary
* defined start_response inside handle_connection
* added a base template and refactored old templates accordingly
* added titles to all templates

2014-02-06  Maxwell Brown

* Changed server_tests.py to not be frustrating
* Did heavy remodel of code based off of brtaylor92
* Tried rendering with Jinja2, broke tests


2014-02-05  Maxwell Brown

* Added <p> tags to my html
* Started making templates (/index, /file, and /image done)

2014-02-04  Maxwell Brown

* Now sort recv text with StringIO and FieldStorage
* Store HTTP Headers in FieldStorage
! Tried and failed to implement return HTML using FieldStorage

2014-02-03  Maxwell Brown

* Added docstrings for most functions 
  (not the ones that returned long strings, to avoid confusion)
* Implemented read_connection function to do block reading on 
  connections with conn.recv
? Created a handler in the server.py for the FakeConnection to handle
  conn.settimeout(n). It works in the browser but not nosetests.
? Created FakeConnection.timeout and FakeConnection.settimeout(n)
  for the conn.settimeout(n) in read_connection(conn). Needed?
* Initialized templates directory
* Added 404 handling in server.py and server_tests.py

2014-01-31  Maxwell Brown

* Reorganized code and removed unneeded comments
* Edited code to do conn.send in the page functions instead of
  at the end of the handle_conn function. This allows for 
  implementation of 404 handler, and easier flow of code
  for hw4 changes.

2014-01-30  Maxwell Brown

* Removed the awful global vairalbes of host and port

2014-01-27  Maxwell Brown

* Split pages into seperate functions
* Declared port and host as global functions to be accessed
  in both the handle_connection and in main
* Created /form and /submit pages, and their respective tests
* Defined split_values to handle URL parsing for /form and /submit
  and possibly future use
* Enabled POST requests for /submit, and changed /form to a POST
* CONCERN: Should the arguement for all the pages be the variables 
           in dict form? Or should those be sorted out inside the
           page function?
